As a runner, I want to mark a training session as completed, so that I can track what I've actually accomplished.

[] **The one where I see this week's volume**:
As a runner, I want to see the total planned distance/time for the current week, so that I understand the overall training load I'm committing to.

As a runner, I want rest days to be clearly distinguished from training days, so that I know when recovery is part of the plan.

[] **The one where I see what I've actually done**:
As a runner, I want to see which sessions I've completed versus what was planned, so that I can quickly assess my adherence to the programme.

[] **The one where I track my weekly progress**:
As a runner, I want to see my completed volume compared to the planned volume for the week, so that I can gauge whether I'm on track.

[] **The one where I load my own training plan**:
As a runner, I want to load a training plan from a JSON file on disk, so that I can use the app with my own programme rather than the bundled one.
