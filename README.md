# Training Tracker

An application for tracking progress through running training programmes.

## Motivation

This is a hobby project with two main goals:

1. **Practical utility**: Build a tool to help me stay on top of my running training programme by tracking planned sessions, marking completions, and monitoring weekly progress.

2. **Technical exploration**: Get hands-on experience with AI-accelerated coding whilst re-familiarising myself with the modern .NET ecosystem after some time away from C# development.

## Project Overview

The application displays a training programme in a calendar view, showing planned training sessions for each day or indicating rest days. Users can check off completed sessions and view weekly training volumes (both planned and actual).

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET MAUI
- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern

## Current Status

Implementation for a first release is underway.
